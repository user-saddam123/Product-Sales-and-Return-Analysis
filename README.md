## Insights:

 * #### CY Sales by Month:
Utilizing a line chart, I've visualized product category sales over each month of the current year (CY). This graphical representation offers a clear view of the sales trends by month.

 * #### PY Sales by Month:
Similarly, another line chart has been employed to present the sales trends based on product categories for the previous year (PY). This facilitates a comparative analysis of sales performance over time.

 * #### Order by Segment:
A donut chart has been employed to illustrate the distribution of orders across different segments. This visualization enables a quick assessment of order volumes by segment.

 * #### CY and PY Sales by Region:
A 100% stacked column chart has been utilized to showcase CY and PY sales figures categorized by region. This visualization provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance across different regions, allowing for easy comparison between the current and previous years.

 * #### Category Ranking:
To offer insights into category performance, a table has been created displaying customer names alongside the order of categories based on month and year. This allows stakeholders to identify the top-performing categories over specific periods.
